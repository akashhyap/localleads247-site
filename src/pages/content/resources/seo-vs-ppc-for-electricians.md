intro:
  title: "The Core Dilemma: Immediate Calls vs. Long-Term Growth"
  description: "Every electrician wants their phone to ring with high-quality jobs. Both Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising can make that happen, but they work in fundamentally different ways. Understanding this difference is the key to avoiding wasted ad spend and building a sustainable pipeline of work."

  title: "What is SEO? The Long-Term Asset"
  description: "Think of SEO as buying and building a workshop. It takes time and a significant upfront investment, but once it's built, it's a valuable asset that generates work for you for years to come. SEO is the process of optimizing your website to rank organically (for free) on Google when customers search for terms like 'electrician in Las Vegas' or 'EV charger installation.'<br><br><strong>Pros:</strong> Builds a lasting digital asset, generates 'free' clicks once you rank, builds immense trust and authority, typically has a higher long-term ROI.<br><br><strong>Cons:</strong> Takes a long time to see results (6-12 months), requires a consistent investment in content and technical optimization."

  title: "What is PPC? The Immediate Results Engine"
  description: "Think of PPC as renting a billboard on the busiest highway in town. As soon as you pay, your ad is visible to everyone, and the traffic starts immediately. PPC platforms like Google Ads allow you to pay to place your website at the very top of the search results for specific keywords.<br><br><strong>Pros:</strong> Delivers immediate traffic and leads, highly targeted to specific services and locations, easily scalable up or down.<br><br><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be expensive (you pay for every click), the traffic stops the moment you stop paying, requires expert management to avoid wasted spend."
