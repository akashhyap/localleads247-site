intro:
  title: "The Core Difference: Capturing Demand vs. Creating Demand"
  description: "The most important concept to understand is the user's mindset on each platform. This is the difference between 'intent' and 'interruption.'<br><br>Google Ads is about capturing existing demand. People go to Google when they have an immediate need or question. They are actively searching for a solution, like 'best landscape designer in Summerlin' or 'sprinkler repair near me.'<br><br>Facebook/Meta Ads is about creating new demand. People are on Facebook to scroll through photos of friends and family. They are not actively looking for a landscaper. Your ad *interrupts* their feed to inspire them and make them aware of a need they didn't know they had."

  description: "Google Ads is your go-to platform for attracting high-intent, 'ready-to-buy' customers. It's most effective for:<br><br>• Generating leads for specific, need-based services: Think of things like broken irrigation systems, tree trimming, or seasonal yard clean-ups.<br><br>• Capturing clients actively seeking quotes: When a homeowner is searching for 'paver patio cost' or 'outdoor kitchen builders,' you want to be the first result they see.<br><br>• Dominating your local service area: It's perfect for targeting searches that include your specific neighborhoods, like 'landscaper in Henderson.'"

  description: "Facebook (Meta) Ads are your best tool for building your brand and generating leads for high-end, visual projects. Your beautiful portfolio is your biggest asset here. Facebook is most effective for:<br><br>• Showcasing your best work to affluent homeowners: You can target users by zip code, income level, and interests (like home improvement shows), putting your stunning project photos in front of people who can afford them.<br><br>• Inspiring large-scale projects: A beautiful video of a custom outdoor fireplace or a resort-style pool deck can plant the seed for a homeowner's next big project.<br><br>• Promoting seasonal offers and packages: Use Facebook to promote things like 'Spring Cleanup' packages or 'Fall Planting' specials to your target audience.<br><br><img src='/placeholder-diagram.jpg' alt='A split-screen graphic.
