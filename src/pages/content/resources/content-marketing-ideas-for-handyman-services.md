intro:
  title: "The Handyman's Marketing Challenge"
  description: "Unlike a specialized trade, a handyman's greatest strength—versatility—can also be a marketing weakness. How do you advertise for 'a little bit of everything'? The key is to stop thinking about selling your services and start thinking about demonstrating your expertise and reliability. Content marketing is the perfect tool for this."

beforeAfterPhotos:
  title: "1. Showcase Your Work with Before-and-After Photos"
  description: "Your work is visual. The single most powerful piece of content you can create is a high-quality before-and-after photo. Whether it's a perfectly patched piece of drywall, a newly mounted TV, or a freshly painted room, these images are undeniable proof of your skill. Share them on your website, your Google Business Profile, and social media."

howToVideos:
  title: "2. Create Simple 'How-To' Videos for Common Repairs"
  description: "You don't need a professional film crew. Use your smartphone to record short, helpful videos (1-2 minutes) explaining how to do a simple task, like fixing a running toilet or changing an air filter. This positions you as a helpful expert. Homeowners who see your expertise are more likely to call you when they have a job they *can't* do themselves."

googleProfile:
  title: "3. Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP)"
  description: "Your GBP is your most important local marketing asset. It's not just a listing; it's a content platform. Regularly upload photos of your work, post weekly updates about services you're offering, and actively encourage and respond to customer reviews. This is a core part of modern local SEO.<br><br><img src='/placeholder-gbp-image.jpg' alt='A screenshot of a well-optimized Google Business Profile for a handyman, showing recent posts and photos.'>"

servicesPage:
  title: "4. Publish a 'Services We Offer' Page with Details"
  description: "Don't just list your services. Create a detailed page on your website that explains *what* you do. Have a section for 'Drywall & Painting,' 'Minor Electrical,' 'Assembly,' etc. This helps Google understand the full scope of your expertise and helps you rank for hundreds of specific, long-tail searches."

realEstatePartners:
  title: "5. Partner with Local Real Estate Agents"
  description: "Real estate agents are a goldmine for handyman work. They constantly need reliable professionals for pre-sale repairs and new homeowner 'to-do' lists. Create a simple, one-page PDF or info packet specifically for real estate agents that outlines your services and makes it easy for them to refer you."

videoTestimonials:
  title: "6. Collect and Showcase Video Testimonials"
  description: "Written reviews are great, but a video testimonial is incredibly powerful. After a successful job, simply ask a happy client if they'd be willing to say a few words on camera about their experience. A 30-second clip of a real customer praising your work is more persuasive than any ad you could ever run."

dayPackage:
  title: "7. Create 'Handyman for a Day' Package Offers"
  description: "Bundle your time into an attractive package. Market a 'Handyman for a Day' or 'Half-Day' special on social media and your website. This is an easy-to-understand offer that's perfect for homeowners with a long list of small tasks they need done at once."
